### Scenario Description

This dataset captures the process of trucks loading goods at a factory, recording the following stages:
              queueing outside the factory → entering the factory→ queueing outside the warehouse → entering the warehouse for loading → leaving the factory.

The number of parking spots available outside different warehouses varies, and the loading time required for different goods is not the same. The dataset comprises three tables that record information about the warehouses, goods, and the status of the trucks.

### Table Description

1. cargo_info.csv 

   Records the time required for loading cargo.

2. warehouse_info.csv  

   Records the number of parking spaces available outside the warehouse and the types of cargo stored inside the warehouse.

3. queuing_info.csv 

   Records the status changes of trucks arriving at the facility over the course of three months.
